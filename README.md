# Business-Performance-Analysis-Using-Excel-SQL
This project simulates a real-world e-commerce analytics scenario, where raw transactional data is transformed into actionable business insights using Excel and SQL.

The goal is to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, profitability, and operational issues (returns, cancellations, payment failures), exactly the kind of analysis expected from a Data Analyst in an e-commerce or product-based company.

### Dataset Description
The analysis is based on a relational e-commerce dataset (100+ rows) consisting of multiple interconnected tables:
**Customers** – demographics, location, signup behavior
**Products** – category, pricing, and cost structure
**Orders** – order lifecycle and fulfillment status
**Order Items** – line-level sales and discounts
**Payments** – payment methods and success/failure status
